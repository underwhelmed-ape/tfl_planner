# London Underground Planner

## Planning a journey from Bethnal Green

This was a project initially created during an excellent [Founders and Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/) Weekend Coders workshop on using APIs. This planner uses JQuery to interrogate the Transport for London API, and use moment.js to turn the extracted times from the API into human readable results.

This shows the trains leaving Bethnal Green tube station, their time and final destination.

Using TfL API with JQuery and Javascript.
